## Observations
### About the Table
I'm creating the table dinamically based on response.

### About the Task
There was a gap between 2012 and 2020 in the API endpoints.
I've used the 1901-2012 API to get all the information displayed on the chart.
However, I'm showing data from a JSON due to the deployment platform and problems with Https.

### About the Rect 
I was not able to complete successfully the hottest and coldest task.
